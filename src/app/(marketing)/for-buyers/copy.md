## Section 2: Problem Agitation

**Section Title**
You already know how this goes.

**Pain Point 1**
Title: The phone-around game wastes your week.
Description: You need 4,000 sq ft of engineered oak for a mid-rise project. So you spend two days calling distributors, leaving voicemails, and chasing quotes — only to find out the lot you wanted sold yesterday. There's no central place to see what's actually available and what it costs.

**Pain Point 2**
Title: "Great deal" turns into a quality nightmare.
Description: You bought a pallet of closeout LVP from a contact's contact. It arrived short by 300 sq ft, the dye lots didn't match, and there were no photos or specs to reference in the dispute. When you buy outside a structured marketplace, you have no recourse.

**Pain Point 3**
Title: Pricing is a black box.
Description: Call five distributors for the same product and you'll get five different prices — none of them posted publicly. There's no baseline, no transparency, and no way to know if you're getting a fair deal or being taken advantage of because you asked first.

**Pain Point 4**
Title: Good lots are gone before you hear about them.
Description: Surplus flooring moves fast. The best overstock — mill-direct hardwood, discontinued premium LVP, name-brand engineered clearouts — gets picked up by buyers who are already plugged into the right networks. If you're not in that network, you're always a step behind.

## Section 3: Solution Introduction

**Transition**
There's a better way to source. PlankMarket puts the entire surplus flooring market in one place, with transparent pricing, verified sellers, and everything you need to buy with confidence.

**Value Proposition 1**
Title: One marketplace for all surplus flooring inventory.
Description: Stop calling distributors one by one. Browse hundreds of lots — hardwood, engineered, laminate, LVP, bamboo, tile — from verified manufacturers and distributors across all 50 states. Filter by material, species, square footage, condition, price, and location.
Supporting detail: Set saved search alerts and get notified the moment a matching lot is listed. The best inventory goes fast — alerts give you a real head start.

**Value Proposition 2**
Title: Every listing is fully documented. No surprises.
Description: PlankMarket requires detailed specs on every listing: material type, species, dimensions, grade, finish, condition, pallet count, and up to 20 high-resolution photos. You see exactly what you're buying before you commit.
Supporting detail: 44 flooring-specific data fields per listing — more detail than any general marketplace or broker call will ever give you.

**Value Proposition 3**
Title: Verified sellers. Secure payment. Real buyer protection.
Description: Every seller on PlankMarket undergoes business verification — EIN verification, document review, and admin approval — before listing a single lot. Payments are processed via Stripe and held in escrow until the carrier picks up your order.
Supporting detail: If something goes wrong, our dispute resolution team steps in. Buyers have 48 hours post-delivery to report damage or shortage, with photo documentation.

## Section 4: How It Works

**Section Title**
Four steps from search to delivery.

**Step 1**
Number: 1
Title: Create your free buyer account.
Description: Register with your business information. Business verification keeps the marketplace professional — only verified businesses can buy and sell. Approval typically takes 1–3 business days.

**Step 2**
Number: 2
Title: Browse or search for the inventory you need.
Description: Use advanced filters to narrow by material, species, condition, lot size, price per sq ft, and seller location. Save searches and set alerts so you never miss a matching lot.

**Step 3**
Number: 3
Title: Make an offer or buy at the listed price.
Description: Found the right lot? Buy now at the listed price or use the built-in offer tool to negotiate directly with the seller. All communication stays on-platform — no sharing contact information until your order is placed.

**Step 4**
Number: 4
Title: Pay securely and track your freight shipment.
Description: Check out via Stripe. Your payment is held in escrow. Once the seller ships your order via LTL freight, you get a tracking number and can follow delivery through your buyer dashboard. Your funds are only released to the seller after carrier pickup is confirmed.

## Section 7: Pricing Transparency

**Section Title**
One fee. No surprises.

**Headline**
You pay 3% on top of the listed price. That's it.

**Description**
The 3% buyer fee covers payment processing, buyer protection, dispute resolution, platform support, and freight coordination tools. There are no membership fees, no listing access fees, and no charges to browse.

**Fee Example**
- Listed lot price: $8,000
- Buyer fee (3%): $240
- You pay: $8,240 + freight (quoted separately at checkout)
- Seller receives: $7,840 (after their 2% fee)

Traditional brokers: Charge 8–15% commission, provide no transparent pricing, and add weeks to the process.
Calling distributors directly: No central visibility, inconsistent pricing, and no buyer protection on side deals.
General marketplaces (eBay, Craigslist): Unverified sellers, no flooring-specific specs, no freight integration, no dispute resolution for commercial freight.

**No Hidden Fees Messaging**
No subscription. No listing access fees. No renewal charges. You pay 3% only when you complete a purchase.

## Section 8: FAQ

**Q1**
Question: Who can buy on PlankMarket?
Answer: PlankMarket is a B2B marketplace for flooring professionals. To buy, you need to create an account and complete business verification — your business name, contact information, and EIN are reviewed and approved by our team, typically within 1–3 business days. This keeps the marketplace professional and ensures you're dealing with verified sellers.

**Q2**
Question: What types of flooring are available?
Answer: PlankMarket lists overstock, closeout, discontinued, and surplus inventory across six categories: hardwood, engineered wood, laminate, vinyl/LVP, bamboo, and tile. Inventory includes new overstock, discontinued lines, factory seconds, remnants, customer returns, and slightly damaged lots clearly marked and described.

**Q3**
Question: Can I negotiate on price?
Answer: Yes. Every listing supports direct offers. Submit your offer, and the seller can accept, counter, or decline — all within a 48-hour response window. The offer history is visible to both parties throughout the negotiation.

**Q4**
Question: How does shipping work?
Answer: PlankMarket uses integrated LTL freight. When you check out, you enter your delivery address and we generate freight quotes from our carrier network. You select a rate, and the freight cost is added to your order. The seller ships via LTL, and you can track the shipment in real time through your buyer dashboard.

**Q5**
Question: What happens if my order arrives damaged or short?
Answer: Note any visible damage on the delivery receipt (BOL) at the time of delivery. Then open a dispute in your buyer dashboard within 48 hours with photo evidence. Our support team will mediate the claim. Payments are held in escrow until carrier pickup, providing an additional layer of protection.

**Q6**
Question: Is my payment information secure?
Answer: Yes. All payments are processed through Stripe, which is PCI-compliant and used by millions of businesses worldwide. PlankMarket never stores your payment card information. Your funds are held in escrow after payment and only released to the seller once carrier pickup is confirmed.
