## Section 2: Problem Agitation

**Section Title**
Every day that surplus sits, it's costing you.

**Pain Point 1**
Title: Warehouse space isn't free — and overstock fills it fast.
Description: You're paying per square foot to store inventory that isn't moving. A 5,000 sq ft lot of discontinued engineered oak sitting on pallets for six months isn't just lost revenue — it's active overhead. That rack space has a price tag, and it compounds every week the inventory stays.

**Pain Point 2**
Title: Your sales channels weren't built for liquidation.
Description: Your wholesale accounts don't want last year's closeout SKUs. Your reps are focused on active product lines. And posting lots on general classifieds or calling around to liquidators means weeks of low-ball offers, no-shows, and time your team doesn't have. You need a channel built specifically for surplus flooring.

**Pain Point 3**
Title: Capital tied up in inventory is capital you can't use.
Description: That $200,000 in overstock sitting in your warehouse looks like an asset on paper — but it's not working for you. Every month it doesn't move, depreciation and storage eat into your recovery. The longer it sits, the less you'll get for it.

**Pain Point 4**
Title: Unverified buyers waste everyone's time.
Description: Posting on open marketplaces brings in hobbyists, flippers, and low-ball offers from people who aren't serious buyers. You field inquiries for weeks, share detailed photos and specs, and then the deal falls apart. You need access to verified flooring professionals with real purchasing budgets and the intent to close.

## Section 3: Solution Introduction

**Transition**
PlankMarket was built specifically to solve the surplus flooring problem — a dedicated channel that connects your inventory to verified buyers who are ready to purchase, with the tools to make the process fast and friction-free.

**Value Proposition 1**
Title: Reach a network of verified flooring buyers across all 50 states.
Description: PlankMarket's buyer network consists exclusively of verified businesses — flooring contractors, retail stores, builders, and purchasing managers — who have registered specifically to source surplus inventory. They're not browsing casually. They have projects to fill and budgets to spend.
Supporting detail: Buyers set up saved search alerts for specific products. When your lot matches their criteria, they're notified immediately — driving faster inquiries from buyers who already want what you're selling.

**Value Proposition 2**
Title: List in minutes. Our AI does the heavy lifting.
Description: PlankMarket's AI-assisted listing tool drafts your product description from the specs you enter — material type, dimensions, condition, lot size. Upload your photos, set your price, review the draft, and publish. No copywriting, no formatting, no hours of admin work per lot.
Supporting detail: AI-powered listing creation, up to 20 photos per listing, and 44 flooring-specific fields ensure your lots are presented with the detail buyers need to commit — which means faster, more confident offers.

**Value Proposition 3**
Title: Get paid fast. No cash flow surprises.
Description: Buyers pay through Stripe at checkout. Your funds are held securely until the carrier picks up the shipment — then payment is released to your Stripe Connect account automatically. No chasing invoices, no net-30 terms, no collections calls.
Supporting detail: Funds typically arrive in your bank within 3–5 business days after carrier pickup. Your seller dashboard shows real-time earnings, payout status, and full transaction history.

## Section 4: How It Works

**Section Title**
From listing to payout in four steps.

**Step 1**
Number: 1
Title: Register and complete business verification.
Description: Create a seller account with your business name, EIN, and company details. Our team reviews applications within 1–3 business days. Verified status is displayed on your listings — it builds buyer trust and accelerates deals.

**Step 2**
Number: 2
Title: List your surplus inventory.
Description: Use our step-by-step listing flow. Enter material specs, upload up to 20 photos, set your asking price, and choose whether to accept offers or Buy Now only. Our AI drafts your listing description — you review and publish.

**Step 3**
Number: 3
Title: Negotiate and close.
Description: Buyers can purchase at your listed price or submit an offer. You accept, counter, or decline — all within the platform. Once a deal is agreed, the buyer pays via Stripe and your order appears in your seller dashboard.

**Step 4**
Number: 4
Title: Ship it. Get paid.
Description: Coordinate LTL freight through the platform's integrated carrier network. Once the carrier picks up the shipment, payment is automatically released. Funds arrive in your bank within 3–5 business days.

Sellers who stopped sitting on surplus.

**Testimonial 1**
Quote: "We had 18,000 sq ft of discontinued engineered hickory taking up three rack bays for almost a year. Listed it on PlankMarket on a Tuesday — had four offers by Friday and it was sold and scheduled for pickup the following week. That's faster than anything our sales team had managed in months."

**Testimonial 2**
Quote: "The AI listing tool is the part I wasn't expecting to care about — but it saves my team real time. We have closeouts cycling through constantly and listing each one used to be a full admin task. Now we upload photos, enter the specs, review the draft, and publish. It's genuinely quick."
Name: Sandra L.
Role: Operations Director

## Section 7: Pricing Transparency

**Section Title**
2% on what you sell. Zero on what you don't.

**Headline**
No listing fees. No monthly subscription. Pay 2% only when a sale completes.

**Description**
PlankMarket charges a 2% commission on completed sales. That commission covers access to the buyer network, payment processing infrastructure, buyer verification, dispute mediation, messaging tools, freight coordination, and platform support. You pay nothing to list, nothing monthly, and nothing on inventory that doesn't sell.

**Fee Example**
- Your listed price: $12,000
- Seller commission (2%): $240
- Your payout: $11,760 (transferred to your Stripe Connect account)
- Buyer pays: $12,360 (listed price + 3% buyer fee — separate from your payout)

**Comparison to Alternatives**
Traditional liquidators: Typically pay 30–50 cents on the dollar for your inventory — a fraction of what you'd recover through direct sale.
Freight brokers and middlemen: Add markup layers, provide no buyer network, and give you no visibility into the transaction.
Open classifieds or general marketplaces: No flooring-specific tooling, no verified buyers, no freight integration, no payment protection.

**Volume Sellers Note**
High-volume sellers with large inventories or frequent transactions may be eligible for reduced commission rates. Contact our partnerships team at partnerships@plankmarket.com to discuss custom pricing.

**No Hidden Fees Messaging**
No subscription fee. No listing or insertion fee. No renewal fee on unsold inventory. No payout or withdrawal fee. No featured placement charges.

## Section 8: FAQ

**Q1**
Question: What types of inventory can I list?
Answer: You can list any surplus, overstock, discontinued, or closeout flooring inventory across six material categories: hardwood, engineered wood, laminate, vinyl/LVP, bamboo, and tile. Supported conditions include new overstock, discontinued lines, closeouts, factory seconds, remnants, customer returns, and slightly damaged inventory — as long as condition is accurately described and documented.

**Q2**
Question: How does business verification work?
Answer: When you register as a seller, you submit your business name, EIN, company details, and supporting documentation. Our team reviews your application — including AI-assisted document and website analysis — and typically completes verification within 1–3 business days. Verified status appears on your listings and increases buyer confidence.

**Q3**
Question: Can I set a minimum lot size or split lots?
Answer: Yes. When creating a listing, you can specify whether the lot must be sold as a whole or if you're willing to split. You can also set a minimum order quantity. Buyers will see these terms on the listing before making an offer.

**Q4**
Question: When do I get paid?
Answer: Once the carrier picks up your shipment, payment is automatically released from escrow and transferred to your connected Stripe account. Funds are typically available in your bank within 3–5 business days of pickup. You can view real-time payout status in your seller dashboard.

**Q5**
Question: What if a buyer disputes the order?
Answer: Buyers have 48 hours after delivery to open a dispute, supported by photo evidence and delivery receipt notes. Our support team mediates the dispute. Freight damage must be noted on the Bill of Lading at time of delivery. If no dispute is filed within 5 business days of delivery, the transaction closes automatically and your funds are confirmed.

**Q6**
Question: Is there a limit to how many lots I can list?
Answer: No. Listings are unlimited. List one lot or a hundred — there are no per-listing fees and no inventory caps. For high-volume sellers managing large portfolios, contact our team about CSV bulk upload and enterprise account options.
