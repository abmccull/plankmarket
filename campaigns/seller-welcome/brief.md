# Campaign: Seller Welcome

## Goal
Move new seller signups from registration to first listing created within 14 days. Secondary: first completed sale within 30 days. Target: 40%+ of new sellers create at least one listing within 14 days of signup.

## Sequence Type
Welcome (onboarding)

## Emails
7 emails over 14 days

## Angle
The Depreciation Clock -- "Every day closeout flooring sits in a warehouse, it loses value. PlankMarket is the fastest path from excess inventory to verified buyer, before the clock runs out." Secondary angle: The Verified Network.

## Audience Segment
Sellers: flooring manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers sitting on surplus, closeout, discontinued, or overstock inventory. They think in pallets, sq ft, warehouse bays, rack space, recovery percentage, and write-offs. Primary pain: $200K+ in capital tied up in warehouse space with carrying costs compounding at ~20% annually.

## Lead Magnet
N/A -- this is a product onboarding sequence triggered by account creation, not a lead magnet opt-in.

## Paid Offer
PlankMarket marketplace (2% seller fee on completed sales only). The "offer" is listing their inventory. No subscription. No listing fees.

## Bridge Logic
Signup -> complete business verification -> connect Stripe -> create first listing -> get first sale. Each email moves the seller one step closer. The depreciation clock creates urgency around inaction.

## Timeline
Day 0 through Day 14

## ESP
Manual / copy-paste

## Voice Notes
Direct, trustworthy, urgent, grounded. Professional but not corporate -- experienced sales rep at a trade show. Lead with numbers. Use industry terms naturally (species, grade, MOQ, LVP, engineered, pallet, rack bay). "Surplus" not "dead inventory." No sign-off needed (branded footer handles it). Sender: "PlankMarket." One CTA per email. Subject lines 40-60 characters. No manufactured urgency -- the inventory depreciation is real.
