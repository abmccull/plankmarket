# Email 2: Connect Stripe

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Set up payouts -- 3-5 day deposits" -- recommended
Leads with the benefit (fast payouts) and includes a specific number. Sellers care about cash flow. This subject line speaks directly to that.

### B: "Your inventory is depreciating right now"
The Depreciation Clock angle. Bold, factual, creates urgency through truth rather than manufactured pressure. May polarize but will stand out.

### C: "One more step before your first listing"
Task-oriented, progress-focused. Sellers who are motivated to list will open to find out what is standing between them and going live.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests benefit-driven (payout speed) against pain-driven (depreciation cost). Reveals whether this audience is motivated more by the upside of selling or the cost of not selling.

## Preview Text

Your business is verified. Next step: connect your Stripe account so you can get paid.

PlankMarket uses Stripe Connect for all seller payouts. Here is how it works:

- Buyer purchases your listing
- Funds are held in escrow until carrier pickup is confirmed
- Payout hits your Stripe account in 3-5 business days
- 2% seller fee is deducted automatically -- no invoices, no surprises

There are no listing fees. No subscription. No monthly minimum. You pay 2% only when inventory sells.

[Connect Stripe Account]

Setup takes about 3 minutes. Once connected, you are ready to create your first listing.

The math on waiting: the average distributor's carrying cost runs ~20% of inventory value per year. On a $200K surplus position, that is $40K annually in warehouse space, insurance, handling, and depreciation -- roughly $110 per day.

Every day that inventory sits, your recovery margin shrinks.

**P.S.** Already have a Stripe account? Even faster. PlankMarket connects to your existing account -- no new setup required.
