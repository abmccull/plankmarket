# Email 5: Bulk Upload

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "List your entire warehouse in one upload" -- recommended
Speaks to high-volume sellers directly. "Entire warehouse" paints the picture of scale. "One upload" reduces perceived effort to a single action.

### B: "CSV bulk upload is live for your account"
Feature-announcement style. Direct, no ambiguity. Works well for sellers who have been waiting for this capability or are already familiar with bulk listing tools.

### C: "Moving 50+ lots? There is a faster way."
Qualifies the audience in the subject line. Sellers with large surplus positions will self-select. Creates curiosity about the "faster way."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests aspirational scale (entire warehouse) against qualified urgency (50+ lots). Reveals whether sellers respond better to the vision of clearing everything or to a practical threshold that matches their reality.

## Preview Text
"One spreadsheet. All your surplus inventory. Live in minutes."

## Send Timing
Day 7 -- Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET
One week after signup. Sellers who have already listed get a tool to scale up. Sellers who have not listed get a lower-friction path to their first listing (batch over one-at-a-time).

If you are sitting on 10, 50, or 500 surplus lots, listing them one at a time does not make sense. That is why PlankMarket supports CSV bulk upload.

Here is how it works:

1. Download the PlankMarket CSV template
2. Fill in your inventory data (same 44 fields as the listing form)
3. Upload the file
4. Review the imported listings
5. Publish all at once

One spreadsheet. Your entire surplus catalog. Live on the marketplace in minutes.

[Download CSV Template]

The template maps directly to PlankMarket's flooring-specific data fields. If you already maintain a product catalog in Excel or your ERP system, most of the data transfers directly. Material type, species, grade, finish, dimensions, quantity, condition, pricing -- it is all there.

For sellers managing large surplus positions, bulk upload changes the math. Instead of spending an afternoon creating listings, you spend 20 minutes formatting a spreadsheet. The rest of your day goes back to running your business.

Already listed a few lots individually? Bulk upload works alongside your existing listings. Add 5 or 500 more without touching what is already live.

If you need help mapping your catalog to the template, reply to this email. We will walk you through it.

**P.S.** Your current recovery rate on surplus inventory through traditional channels -- broker calls, email blasts, trade show conversations -- is probably 40-60 cents on the dollar. On PlankMarket, verified buyers compete for your lots. That changes the math.
