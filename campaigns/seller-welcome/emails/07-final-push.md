# Email 7: Final Push

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Last email about getting started" -- recommended
Signals a transition. Sellers who have been ignoring the sequence will open because the series is ending. Creates scarcity around the onboarding support itself, not the product.

### B: "The clock is still running on your surplus"
Final Depreciation Clock reminder. Persistent but factual. Two weeks have passed. The carrying costs have not stopped.

### C: "What sellers are listing on PlankMarket"
Social proof and curiosity. Implies other sellers are active. Creates FOMO grounded in marketplace activity rather than artificial scarcity.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests "last chance" framing against social proof. Reveals whether this audience responds to finality (the series is ending) or peer behavior (other sellers are active).

## Preview Text
"After this, we will move to regular marketplace updates."

## Send Timing
Day 14 -- Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET
Two weeks after signup. Final onboarding email. After this, sellers move to the regular marketplace update cadence. Tuesday morning for maximum B2B engagement.

## Email Copy

This is the last onboarding email. After this, you will receive periodic marketplace updates -- new features, buyer demand trends, and platform news. No more step-by-step setup prompts.

Two weeks have passed since you signed up. Here is what is happening on PlankMarket right now:

- Sellers are listing surplus hardwood, engineered, LVP, laminate, and tile
- Buyers are setting saved search alerts for specific species, grades, and price ranges
- Offers are being negotiated and completed through the messaging system
- Payouts are landing in seller Stripe accounts within 3-5 business days

The marketplace is moving. The question is whether your surplus inventory is part of it.

If you have already listed -- great. Consider adding more lots. Sellers with 10+ active listings see significantly more buyer engagement than sellers with 1-2 listings. Volume creates visibility.

If you have not listed yet, here is the honest assessment:

Your surplus flooring is not going to appreciate. It is not going to become more desirable as newer products enter the market. The best recovery rate you will get on closeout inventory is today. Tomorrow it is worth slightly less. The day after that, slightly less again.

PlankMarket removes the friction between your warehouse and a verified buyer. No listing fees. No subscription. 2% on completed sales. 3-5 day payouts.

One lot. Five minutes. Start there.

[List Your First Lot]

If PlankMarket is not the right fit for your business, no hard feelings. But if surplus inventory is taking up warehouse space and tying up capital, the math favors action over waiting.

After this email, you will hear from us with marketplace updates and new features. Your account is ready whenever you are.
