# Email 6: Depreciation Nudge

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your surplus inventory lost value this week" -- recommended
The Depreciation Clock angle at full strength. Factual, not manufactured. Surplus flooring genuinely depreciates. This subject line makes the cost of inaction concrete and time-bound ("this week").

### B: "Still sitting on closeout flooring?"
Direct question that mirrors what the seller is probably thinking. No manipulation -- just a straightforward acknowledgment of the situation. Slightly confrontational in a productive way.

### C: "10 days since you signed up"
Accountability through specificity. The exact number of days creates a "time is passing" awareness without being aggressive. Personal because it references their specific timeline.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests factual depreciation framing against conversational confrontation. Reveals whether sellers respond to data (lost value) or directness (still sitting on it?).

## Preview Text
"Carrying costs do not pause. Neither should your liquidation strategy."

## Send Timing
Day 10 -- Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Ten days after signup. This is the re-engagement email for sellers who have completed verification and Stripe but have not created a listing. For sellers who have listed, this email reinforces the value of adding more inventory.

## Email Copy

It has been 10 days since you created your PlankMarket account.

In that time, your surplus inventory kept costing you money. Warehouse space. Insurance. Handling. Depreciation as newer product lines enter the market and your closeout stock gets further from current.

The industry average: carrying costs run ~20% of inventory value annually. On a $100K surplus position, that is roughly $55 per day. On $500K, it is $274 per day.

That number does not pause while you evaluate options.

PlankMarket is not asking you to commit to a contract, a subscription, or a minimum volume. The ask is one listing. Pick the lot that has been sitting the longest. The one taking up rack space you need. The discontinued SKU that is never coming back into the line.

List it. See what happens.

[Create Your First Listing]

What you are not risking:

- No listing fees (it costs nothing to list)
- No subscription (cancel anytime -- there is nothing to cancel)
- No exclusivity (sell the same inventory through your existing channels simultaneously)
- 2% fee only when a sale completes

The only cost of listing is 5 minutes of your time. The cost of not listing is whatever your daily carrying cost is, multiplied by every day you wait.
