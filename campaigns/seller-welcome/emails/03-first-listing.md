# Email 3: First Listing

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "List your first lot in under 5 minutes" -- recommended
Specific time commitment removes the "this will take forever" objection. Uses "lot" (B2B liquidation language). Direct and actionable.

### B: "44 data fields. 20 photos. Zero listing fees."
Numbers-first approach. Shows the depth of the listing format (signals quality to sellers who care about presenting their product well) while reinforcing zero cost.

### C: "Your surplus is ready to move"
Outcome-oriented. Assumes the seller has inventory waiting. Short, punchy, uses preferred vocabulary ("surplus").

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests speed-of-process (under 5 minutes) against depth-of-platform (44 fields, 20 photos). Reveals whether sellers are more concerned about time investment or listing quality.

## Preview Text

## Email Copy

Your account is verified. Stripe is connected. Time to list your first lot.

The listing form is built specifically for flooring. Not a generic product form with a text box. 44 fields that match how buyers search:

- Material type (hardwood, engineered, LVP, laminate, tile, vinyl sheet)
- Species, grade, finish, dimensions
- Condition (new overstock, closeout, discontinued, seconds)
- Quantity in sq ft, number of pallets, MOQ
- Warehouse location and freight availability
- Up to 20 photos per listing

The form has AI-assisted listing creation. Upload a spec sheet or product data, and PlankMarket extracts the details into the right fields. Review, adjust, publish.

Under 5 minutes for most lots.

[Create Your First Listing]

What happens after you publish:

- Your lot appears in search results and category pages immediately
- Buyers with matching saved searches get notified
- You receive offers and messages through the built-in messaging system
- All negotiation and payment happens on-platform

Pricing guidance: set your price based on recovery percentage. Most closeout flooring on PlankMarket moves at 30-60% below original wholesale. Price competitively and inventory moves. Price too high and it sits -- which is the problem you are here to solve.
