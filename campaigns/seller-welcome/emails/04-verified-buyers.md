# Email 4: Verified Buyer Network

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Every buyer on PlankMarket is verified" -- recommended
States the core value proposition directly. For sellers worried about brand integrity and channel conflict, this is the subject line that earns the open.

### B: "No tire-kickers. No unverified accounts."
Addresses the pain point using language sellers actually use. "Tire-kickers" is universally understood in B2B sales. Bold, slightly informal, pattern interrupt.

### C: "The buyer network behind your listings"
Implies there is already demand waiting. Positions the marketplace as infrastructure the seller is tapping into, not building from scratch.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests trust-building (verification as a feature) against pain-acknowledgment (wasted time with unqualified leads). Reveals which framing motivates seller engagement more.

## Email Copy

The biggest risk in liquidation is not the price. It is who you are selling to.

Unverified buyers waste time. They request samples, ghost on offers, or worse -- they are not real businesses. Channel conflict, brand damage, and dead-end negotiations eat margin faster than carrying costs.

PlankMarket handles this differently.

Every buyer on the platform completes business verification before they can purchase or make an offer. That means:

- Confirmed business entity and EIN
- Verified business address
- Active retailer or contractor operation

No anonymous accounts. No consumer buyers posing as trade. No one wasting your time.

When you receive an offer on PlankMarket, it comes from a verified professional with a real business behind it. Negotiate with confidence. Accept or counter through the built-in messaging system.

Your dashboard tracks everything in one place:

- Active listings and views
- Incoming offers and messages
- Sales history and payout status
- Average days on market

If you have not listed your first lot yet, now is the time. Your inventory is losing value every day it sits. The buyers are here. The verification is done. The only missing piece is your listing.

**P.S.** Buyers can also post what they need on the request board. Check it -- someone may already be looking for exactly what you have in stock.
