# Email 1: Welcome + Verify

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your PlankMarket seller account is live" -- recommended
Direct confirmation of what just happened. Matches the expectation set at signup. Highest open rate for welcome emails because it delivers on the action the seller just took.

### B: "One step before you can list inventory"
Creates a small gap -- they signed up but are not done yet. Motivates the open by implying there is a clear next action required.

### C: "You're in -- here's what happens next"
Conversational, forward-looking. Signals that the email contains a roadmap, not just a confirmation.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether sellers respond better to confirmation (account is live) or task-oriented framing (one step remaining). Reveals whether this audience wants reassurance or direction.

## Preview Text
"Complete verification to start listing surplus inventory."

## Send Timing
Day 0 -- Immediately after signup
Welcome emails must send within seconds of account creation. This is the highest-open-rate email in the sequence. Delay erodes trust.

## Email Copy

Your seller account is created.

Before you can list inventory, we need to verify your business. This protects both sides of every transaction -- sellers know they are reaching real retailers, and buyers know they are purchasing from verified professionals.

Verification takes about 2 minutes:

- Business name and EIN
- Primary contact information
- Business type (manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler)

Once verified, you can list your first lot immediately.

[Complete Business Verification]

Here is what the next 14 days look like:

1. Verify your business (now)
2. Connect your Stripe account for payouts
3. Create your first listing
4. Reach verified retailers across all 50 states

Every day surplus flooring sits in a warehouse, carrying costs compound. The average distributor holds ~20% of inventory value annually in storage, insurance, and depreciation. PlankMarket is built to move that inventory to verified buyers fast.
