# Campaign: Buyer Cold Outbound

## Goal
Drive flooring retailers, contractors, and builders to create a free buyer account on PlankMarket. Target: 3-5% reply rate, 8-12% click-through rate across the sequence.

## Sequence Type
Cold outbound prospecting (NOT welcome/nurture -- recipients have never heard of PlankMarket)

## Emails
5 emails over 21 days

## Angle
The Hidden Channel -- "Retailers are leaving margin on the table by paying full wholesale when manufacturers are sitting on closeout inventory they need to move -- PlankMarket connects the two."

## Audience Segment
- Flooring retail store owners and purchasing managers
- General contractors who do flooring installs
- Residential/commercial builders with flooring as a cost line
- Currently sourcing by: calling distributors, trade shows, broker relationships, word of mouth
- Pain: hours on the phone chasing availability, inconsistent pricing, missing the best closeout deals

## Lead Magnet
N/A -- cold outbound. No opt-in. Free platform access is the offer.

## Paid Offer
Free to browse and join PlankMarket. 3% buyer fee only when a purchase is made. The "conversion" is a free account signup.

## Bridge Logic
Cold prospect -> sees margin opportunity they are currently missing -> signs up for free buyer account -> browses closeout inventory -> makes first purchase

## Timeline
Day 1 through Day 21

## Cadence
- Email 1: Day 1 (The Hook)
- Email 2: Day 3 (The Proof)
- Email 3: Day 7 (The Value)
- Email 4: Day 14 (The Objection Handler)
- Email 5: Day 21 (The Breakup)

## ESP
Manual / copy-paste (no ESP detected)

## Status
draft

## Voice Notes
- Cold email demands extreme conciseness: 4-8 sentences max per email
- Tone: direct, trustworthy, urgent, grounded -- experienced sales rep at a trade show
- Lead with numbers and industry terms, not adjectives
- "Surplus" not "dead inventory." No "revolutionizing," "AI-powered," "exclusive," "hurry," "easy," "incredible," "solution."
- Each email attacks from a different angle -- no repeating the same pitch
- Personalization tokens: {{first_name}}, {{company_name}}, {{city}}
- Subject lines: 40-60 characters, no ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation
