# Email 3: The Value

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "The math on closeout vs. full wholesale" -- recommended
Safe bet. "Math" signals concrete, not vague. Flooring buyers think in numbers. Positions the email as worth opening because it contains a calculation, not a pitch.

### B: "How much margin are you leaving on the table"
Bold play. Directly challenges their current sourcing process. The implied answer is "a lot." Risk: could feel accusatory to some. But for competitive buyers, it is a hook.

### C: "{{first_name}}, one number to look at"
Personal touch. Curiosity gap plus personalization. Promises brevity -- one number. Low commitment to open. Risk: could underwhelm if the payoff inside is not sharp enough.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests rational appeal (math/data) vs. emotional appeal (fear of lost margin). Critical to understand which lever moves flooring buyers more.

## Preview Text
"A 2,000 sq ft order at $1.80 vs $3.50 per sq ft. You do the math."

## Send Timing
Day 7 -- Tuesday at 7:30 AM recipient's timezone
Full week after first email. Tuesday morning restart. This is the "value" email -- it needs to land when the prospect has mental bandwidth to process a margin calculation.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

Quick math.

A distributor has 2,000 sq ft of first-quality white oak, select grade, wire-brushed finish. It is a closeout -- the line is discontinued. They need it gone.

Full wholesale: $3.50/sq ft.
Closeout price on PlankMarket: $1.80/sq ft.
Your savings on one order: $3,400.

Now multiply that across every flooring job you source this year.

That is the gap between paying standard wholesale and buying closeout inventory directly from the source. The product is the same. The margin is not.

PlankMarket exists to close that gap. Surplus hardwood, engineered, LVP, laminate, and tile -- listed by verified manufacturers and distributors, priced to move.
