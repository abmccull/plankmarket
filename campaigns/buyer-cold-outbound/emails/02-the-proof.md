# Email 2: The Proof

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "What 44 data fields per listing looks like"
Safe bet. Specificity ("44 data fields") creates curiosity and signals credibility. Differentiates from vague liquidation sites. Under 50 characters.

### B: "This is not another liquidation site" -- recommended
Bold play. Pattern interrupt. Addresses the skepticism cold prospects feel after seeing too many discount sites. Draws a clear line in the sand.

### C: "{{first_name}}, here is what is listed right now"
Personal touch. Name personalization plus implied inventory peek. Feels like a direct message. Risk: vague without the subject line doing heavy lifting.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether data specificity or direct differentiation drives more opens. Reveals if this audience is more drawn to proof points or "we are different" positioning.

## Preview Text
"Species. Grade. Finish. Condition. Location. Square footage. Photos. Before you call anyone."

## Send Timing
Day 3 -- Thursday at 7:30 AM recipient's timezone
Two days after first touch. Thursday morning keeps momentum before the weekend. Same early-morning window when purchasing decisions start.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

When you call a distributor about surplus inventory, you get a price and maybe a species. Then you drive two hours to look at it.

Every listing on PlankMarket includes:

- Material type, species, grade, and finish
- Condition (new overstock, closeout, discontinued, seconds)
- Square footage available and MOQ
- Warehouse location and freight estimate
- Photos of the actual product

That is 44 data fields before you pick up the phone or get in your truck.

Sellers are verified distributors and manufacturers. Payments are protected through Stripe. Freight is quoted at checkout.
