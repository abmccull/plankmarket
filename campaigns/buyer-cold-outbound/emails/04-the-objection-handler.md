# Email 4: The Objection Handler

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "You already have suppliers. Read this anyway." -- recommended
Safe bet. Names the objection out loud, then challenges it. Feels honest. The period after "anyway" adds confidence. Acknowledges the reader's reality instead of ignoring it.

### B: "Why surplus does not mean damaged"
Bold play. Tackles the quality skepticism head-on. Any buyer who has been burned by liquidation sites will stop scrolling. Directly addresses the unspoken worry.

### C: "{{first_name}}, a fair question about PlankMarket"
Personal touch. Positions the email as answering something they might already be wondering. Conversational. Low threat. Risk: less specific than A or B.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests which objection is stronger -- "I already have suppliers" vs. "I do not trust surplus quality." Knowing the dominant objection shapes all future messaging.

## Preview Text
"PlankMarket does not replace your suppliers. It fills the gaps they cannot."

## Send Timing
Day 14 -- Wednesday at 7:30 AM recipient's timezone
Full week gap from Email 3. Enough time has passed that this does not feel like a barrage. Wednesday is mid-week -- no Monday noise, no Friday checkout. Objection handling needs clear-headed attention.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

Two things I hear from retailers who have not signed up yet:

**"I already have suppliers I trust."**
Good. Keep them. PlankMarket is not a replacement -- it is an additional channel. When a manufacturer discontinues a line or overproduces, that inventory does not always reach your existing contacts. We surface those lots before they get moved through back channels.

**"How do I know the product is not defective?"**
Every listing includes condition labels: new overstock, closeout, discontinued, or seconds. Seconds are clearly marked. Most inventory on PlankMarket is first-quality product from discontinued lines or overproduction runs. Sellers are verified businesses. Payments run through Stripe.

You can browse every listing with full specs and photos before you create an account. No commitment. No sales calls.
