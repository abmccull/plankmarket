# Email 5: The Breakup

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Last note from PlankMarket" -- recommended
Safe bet. "Last note" signals finality without being dramatic. Breakup emails with this framing consistently get the highest open rates in cold sequences because the prospect knows the ask is ending.

### B: "Not for everyone"
Bold play. Disqualification frame. Implies PlankMarket is selective, which triggers the prospect's desire to self-include. Short. Stands out in an inbox.

### C: "{{first_name}}, closing the loop"
Personal touch. Professional, respectful. Implies a conversation that is wrapping up. Feels like a real person, not a drip campaign.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests straightforward breakup ("last note") vs. disqualification psychology ("not for everyone"). Reveals whether this audience responds to finality or exclusion.

## Preview Text
"Closeout inventory moves whether you are watching or not."

## Send Timing
Day 21 -- Tuesday at 7:30 AM recipient's timezone
Three weeks from first contact. Final email in the sequence. Tuesday morning for maximum visibility. Clean break.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

This is my last email about PlankMarket.

Here is what it is: a B2B marketplace where flooring manufacturers and distributors list closeout, overstock, and discontinued inventory at 30-60% below wholesale. Verified sellers. Detailed specs. Integrated freight quotes.

Here is what it costs: nothing to join, nothing to browse. 3% fee only when you buy.

Closeout inventory is finite. Lots sell and they do not come back. The retailers who see them first get the best margins.

If this is not for {{company_name}}, no hard feelings. But if better sourcing and wider margins matter to you, the inventory is there.
