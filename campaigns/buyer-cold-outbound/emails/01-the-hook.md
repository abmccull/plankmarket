# Email 1: The Hook

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Closeout flooring your competitors miss" -- recommended
Safe bet. Hits the insider-access FOMO angle directly. "Competitors" creates tension without being pushy. Under 50 characters. Implies they are missing something real.

### B: "{{first_name}}, quick question about sourcing"
Bold play. First-name personalization plus curiosity gap. Feels like a 1:1 message, not a blast. Risk: could feel like every other cold email opener.

### C: "30-60% below wholesale on surplus flooring"
Direct benefit. Leads with the number, which the voice profile demands. No ambiguity about what this email is about. Risk: some prospects filter aggressive pricing claims.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether FOMO/competitive angle or straight pricing data drives more opens in this audience. Reveals if flooring buyers respond more to fear of missing out or raw margin numbers.

## Preview Text
"Manufacturers need to move surplus inventory. You need better margins."

## Send Timing
Day 1 -- Tuesday at 7:30 AM recipient's timezone
Flooring professionals start early. Tuesday avoids Monday inbox clearing. 7:30 AM catches them before they hit the warehouse floor or start making calls.
