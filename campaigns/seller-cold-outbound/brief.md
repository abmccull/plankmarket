# Campaign: Seller Cold Outbound

## Goal
Drive flooring manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers to create a free seller account on PlankMarket and list their first lot. Target: 5-8% reply rate, 2-4% signup rate from cold outreach.

## Sequence Type
Cold outbound prospecting (NOT opt-in / welcome / nurture)

## Emails
5 emails over 21 days

## Angle
Primary: **The Depreciation Clock** -- Every day closeout flooring sits in a warehouse, it loses value. PlankMarket is the fastest path from excess inventory to verified buyer, before the clock runs out.

Secondary: **The Verified Network** -- PlankMarket is the only closeout flooring marketplace where every retailer is verified, so manufacturers can liquidate without worrying about brand damage or channel conflict.

## Audience Segment
- Flooring manufacturers with discontinued product lines
- Regional and national flooring distributors with overstock
- Wholesalers sitting on closeout inventory
- Titles: Inventory managers, operations directors, VP of sales, owners

## Current Liquidation Alternatives
- Calling known contacts (slow, limited reach)
- Trade shows (expensive, infrequent)
- Brokers who take 30-50 cents on the dollar
- Writing it off as a loss

## Paid Offer
Free to sign up. Free to list. 2% seller fee only when inventory sells. Get paid in 3-5 days after pickup.

## Bridge Logic
Cold email -> Visit PlankMarket -> Create free seller account -> List first lot -> Sell to verified buyers

## Cadence
| Email | Send Day | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 01 | Day 1 | The Depreciation Clock -- cost of inaction |
| 02 | Day 3 | The Proof -- seller success story |
| 03 | Day 7 | The Trust Angle -- verified buyers, brand protection |
| 04 | Day 14 | The Math -- carrying costs vs. 2% fee |
| 05 | Day 21 | The Breakup -- final touch, inventory still depreciating |

## Personalization Tokens
- `{{first_name}}` -- Prospect's first name
- `{{company_name}}` -- Company name
- `{{city}}` -- Prospect's city
