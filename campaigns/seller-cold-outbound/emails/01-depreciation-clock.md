# Email 1: The Depreciation Clock

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "That surplus is costing you right now" -- recommended
Safe bet. Directly states the problem. Creates immediate tension without hype. The word "right now" adds urgency factually.

### B: "How long has that overstock been sitting?"
Bold play. A question forces the reader to answer mentally. If they have overstock (and they do, that is why they are on the list), this lands. Risk: could feel generic if not paired with good preview text.

### C: "{{first_name}}, quick question about surplus"
Personal touch. First name + "quick question" signals a real person, not a blast. The word "surplus" qualifies the reader immediately -- if they have none, they self-select out.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether a direct statement or a provocative question drives more opens from inventory managers. The winner tells you whether this audience responds to confrontation or reflection.

## Preview Text
"Carrying costs run ~20% of inventory value annually."

## Send Timing

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

Carrying costs on warehouse inventory run ~20% of its value annually. For a pallet of discontinued engineered hardwood, that clock started the day the line was cut.

Every month it sits, you recover less.

PlankMarket is a B2B marketplace built for this. List your surplus flooring -- hardwood, LVP, laminate, tile -- and put it in front of verified retailers across all 50 states.

- 2% seller fee. No listing costs.
- Payout in 3-5 days after pickup.
- Every buyer is business-verified. No tire-kickers.

One seller listed 18,000 sq ft of discontinued hickory on a Tuesday. Four offers by Friday.

**P.S.** The signup takes 3 minutes. The listing form walks you through specs, photos, and pricing. Your inventory could be in front of buyers today.
