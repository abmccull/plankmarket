# Email 4: The Math

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "The math on holding vs. listing"
Safe bet. Promises a concrete comparison. Appeals to the analytical buyer -- operations directors and inventory managers who think in spreadsheets.

### B: "2% fee vs. 20% annual carrying cost" -- recommended
Bold play. Puts the two numbers side by side and lets the reader do the math themselves. The contrast is so stark it almost does not need explanation. Immediate open driver.

### C: "{{first_name}}, ran some numbers"
Personal touch. Feels like a colleague forwarding a quick analysis. Casual and human. "Ran some numbers" implies something useful inside without overselling.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether the hard numerical contrast or the casual personal framing drives more engagement at this stage of the sequence. By email 4, the prospect either responds to data or relationship.

## Preview Text
"A 10,000 sq ft lot at $3/sq ft costs ~$6,000/year to hold."

## Send Timing
Day 14 -- Wednesday at 9:00 AM ET
Two weeks in. The longer gap signals respect for their time while keeping the thread alive. Wednesday is peak B2B open day. This email is for the analytical prospect who needs the numbers to justify action.

{{first_name}},

Here is the math on a 10,000 sq ft lot of closeout engineered hardwood at $3.00/sq ft:

**Cost to hold it:**
- Warehouse space: ~$0.50/sq ft/month
- Insurance, handling, depreciation: ~$0.10/sq ft/month
- Annual carrying cost: ~$6,000+ (20% of inventory value)
- Recovery declines ~5-15% per quarter as the product ages out

**Cost to list it on PlankMarket:**
- Listing fee: $0
- Monthly fee: $0
- Seller fee on a completed sale: 2% ($600 on a $30,000 lot)
- Payout: 3-5 business days after pickup

You pay $600 to move $30,000 worth of inventory. Or you pay $6,000+ per year to watch it depreciate in a rack bay.

That is not a sales pitch. That is arithmetic.
