# Email 2: The Proof

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "18,000 sq ft moved in 4 days" -- recommended
Safe bet. Leads with a specific, impressive number. Flooring people think in square footage. "4 days" answers the speed question before they even ask it.

### B: "What happened after one listing"
Bold play. Opens a curiosity gap. Does not reveal the outcome, which drives opens. Risk: could feel vague to someone who deleted Email 1 without reading.

### C: "{{first_name}}, this seller's week"
Personal touch. Casual, feels like a forwarded story from a colleague. "This seller's week" implies something noteworthy happened without overselling it.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether hard numbers or a personal, story-driven approach drives more engagement. The answer shapes the rest of the sequence.

## Preview Text
"Discontinued hickory. Listed Tuesday. Four offers by Friday."

## Send Timing
Day 3 -- Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Two days after the first email. Thursday morning is high-open for B2B. The gap gives them time to think about the depreciation angle without losing momentum.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

A distributor in {{city}} had 18,000 sq ft of discontinued hickory taking up three rack bays.

They had been calling contacts for weeks. A few nibbles. No real offers.

They listed it on PlankMarket on Tuesday morning. By Friday, four verified retailers had made offers. The lot sold at 68% of original wholesale.

That is not a marketing number. That is what happens when surplus inventory meets a network of buyers actively searching for closeout flooring.

The alternative was another quarter of carrying costs and a lower recovery next month.

**P.S.** Listing is free. There is no fee until your inventory sells. The 2% seller fee only applies on completed transactions.
