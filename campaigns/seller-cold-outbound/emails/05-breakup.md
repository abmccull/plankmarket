# Email 5: The Breakup

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Last note about your surplus inventory" -- recommended
Safe bet. "Last note" signals finality, which drives opens from people who have been on the fence. It is honest -- you are telling them this is the end of the outreach. Respect earns attention.

### B: "Still sitting on that closeout?"
Bold play. Provocative and direct. Calls out the inaction. Works on prospects who have been ignoring the previous emails but know they have a problem. Risk: could feel confrontational to some.

### C: "{{first_name}}, closing the loop"
Personal touch. Business-appropriate way to signal a final follow-up. Feels like a professional wrapping up a conversation, not a marketer sending a drip.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** The breakup email is where you learn whether your audience responds to respectful finality or blunt provocation. This insight shapes all future outreach cadences.

## Preview Text

## Send Timing

Three weeks after the first email. The full cycle is complete. Tuesday morning for maximum visibility. Slightly earlier send time to land at the top of the inbox before the day starts.

## Email Copy

{{first_name}},

I have sent a few emails about moving surplus flooring through PlankMarket. This is the last one.

The short version: PlankMarket connects manufacturers and distributors with verified retailers looking for closeout, overstock, and discontinued flooring. 2% seller fee. No listing costs. Payout in 3-5 days.

Three weeks have passed since my first email. If {{company_name}} has closeout inventory in the warehouse, the carrying costs have continued. The recovery value has not gone up.

If the timing is not right, no hard feelings. But if you have surplus that needs to move, the account is free and the first listing takes minutes.

Either way, I will not fill your inbox further. Appreciate your time.

**P.S.** If this lands on your desk at the wrong time but you want to revisit later, bookmark this: plankmarket.com. We will be here when the next closeout hits.
