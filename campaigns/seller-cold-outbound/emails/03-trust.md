# Email 3: The Trust Angle

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Every buyer on PlankMarket is verified"
Safe bet. States the core trust mechanism plainly. Credible and specific. Works for anyone who has been burned by unqualified buyers wasting their time.

### B: "No flippers. No tire-kickers." -- recommended
Bold play. Uses language the audience actually says behind closed doors. Two short punches. Instantly communicates who is NOT on the platform, which is often more powerful than who is.

### C: "{{first_name}}, who is buying your surplus?"
Personal touch. A question that triggers a real concern -- most sellers have no idea who the end buyer is when they go through brokers. Makes them think about their current process.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether blunt insider language or a thought-provoking question resonates more. Both target the trust pain point from different angles.

## Preview Text
"Business verification, Stripe escrow, and zero channel conflict."

## Send Timing
Day 7 -- Tuesday at 9:30 AM ET
One week in. The prospect has seen the depreciation pitch and the proof. Now address the objection: "Can I trust the buyers?" Tuesday morning resets the cadence after a weekend gap.

{{first_name}},

The biggest risk in liquidating closeout flooring is not the price. It is who ends up with it.

Unverified buyers waste your team's time. Flippers undercut your active retail partners. One bad sale creates channel conflict that costs more than the surplus was worth.

PlankMarket handles this differently:

- **Every buyer completes business verification** before they can transact. Real businesses. Real retail operations.
- **Stripe escrow** holds payment until you confirm pickup. No chasing invoices.
- **You control pricing and terms.** Accept offers, reject them, or set a firm price. Your inventory, your call.

Your sales team should be focused on active product lines. Let PlankMarket move the closeouts to buyers you can trust.

**P.S.** Zero listing fees. Zero monthly fees. The only cost is a 2% fee when a transaction completes. If nothing sells, you pay nothing.
