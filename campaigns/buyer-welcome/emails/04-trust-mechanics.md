# Email 4: Trust Mechanics

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "How PlankMarket protects your purchase" -- recommended
Safe bet. Directly addresses the #1 buyer objection: can I trust this? "Protects your purchase" is specific and benefit-oriented without being vague.

### B: "Verified sellers, escrowed payments"
Bold play. Leads with the two strongest trust mechanisms in a compressed, factual format. No fluff -- just the proof points. Aligns with the "lead with numbers" voice principle.

### C: "What happens if something goes wrong"
Personal touch. Addresses the fear directly. Pattern interrupt -- most marketing emails avoid talking about what could go wrong. This builds trust by confronting the question head-on.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests positive framing ("how we protect") against negative framing ("if something goes wrong"). Both build trust, but through opposite emotional paths. Result reveals whether this audience prefers reassurance or transparency.

## Preview Text
"Every seller is verified. Payments are held in escrow until carrier pickup. 48-hour dispute window after delivery."

## Send Timing
Day 5 -- Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET

Buying surplus flooring online from a seller you have never met. Fair to have questions.

Here is how PlankMarket handles the trust problem.

Seller verification:
Every seller goes through a verification process before they can list. Business registration, EIN documentation, admin review. No anonymous sellers. No unverified accounts.

Payment protection:
When you purchase, your payment goes into escrow via Stripe. The seller does not receive funds until the carrier picks up the shipment. Your money is protected until the product is on its way to you.

Integrated freight:
Real-time LTL freight quotes at checkout. Carrier tracking built in. You know what freight costs before you commit, and you can track the shipment from pickup to delivery.

Dispute window:
You have 48 hours after delivery to inspect the product and file a dispute if something does not match the listing. Dimensions, grade, species, condition -- if the product is not what was described, you are covered.

Transparent fees:
3% buyer fee on completed purchases. That is it. No subscription. No membership. No hidden costs. The fee is visible before you pay.

These are not policies buried in a terms page. They are how every transaction works on PlankMarket.

**P.S.** Questions about a specific listing? Every listing has a Q&A section where you can ask the seller directly before committing.
