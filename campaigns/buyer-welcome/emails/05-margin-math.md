# Email 5: Margin Math

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "The margin math on surplus flooring" -- recommended
Safe bet. "Margin math" speaks directly to the buyer's primary motivation: improve margins. Specific, professional, promises a concrete analysis.

### B: "What 30-60% below wholesale means"
Bold play. Takes the key value prop and makes it the subject line. Creates curiosity -- they know the percentage but want to see the dollar impact. Number-forward per voice profile.

### C: "Run the numbers on your next project"
Personal touch. Action-oriented, invites them to apply the math to their own situation. Conversational tone that respects their ability to evaluate a deal themselves.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests concept framing ("margin math") against number-forward framing ("30-60% below"). Reveals whether buyers prefer the analytical frame or the specific discount claim.

Here is a sourcing scenario.

You need 3,000 sq ft of hickory hardwood, #1 common grade, for a residential project. Your distributor quotes $4.50/sq ft. Standard wholesale. You know the number because you have bought it before.

On PlankMarket, a manufacturer lists the same spec -- hickory, #1 common, 3,200 sq ft available -- as new overstock from a discontinued line. Listed at $2.10/sq ft.

Same species. Same grade. Same quality. Different channel.

The math:

- Standard wholesale: 3,000 sq ft x $4.50 = $13,500
- PlankMarket lot: 3,000 sq ft x $2.10 = $6,300
- 3% buyer fee: $189
- Your cost: $6,489
- You keep: $7,011

That is $7,011 in margin on a single lot. Enough to cover freight, the buyer fee, and still come out significantly ahead.

This is what "30-60% below wholesale" looks like in practice.

Not every lot will show this spread. Some run 30% below. Some run deeper. It depends on why the seller is liquidating and how long the inventory has been sitting.

But the lots are real. The savings are real. And they are available now.
