# Email 7: Direct Ask

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Ready to source your first lot?"
Safe bet. Direct question. Low-pressure framing with "ready" -- puts the timing in their hands. Uses "source" per the vocabulary guide.

### B: "The lots listed today were not here last week" -- recommended
Bold play. Factual scarcity. Communicates the nature of closeout inventory without manufactured urgency. Every word is literally true -- closeout lots are finite and turn over.

### C: "One purchase to see if this works for you"
Personal touch. Lowers the commitment bar. Frames the first purchase as an experiment, not a commitment to a new sourcing channel. Removes pressure.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests factual urgency ("inventory turns over") against low-commitment framing ("one purchase to see"). Reveals whether buyers are more moved by supply dynamics or by reduced risk.

## Email Copy

This is the last email in our welcome series.

You signed up. You have access to surplus, closeout, and overstock flooring from verified sellers at 30-60% below wholesale. Detailed specs. Integrated freight. Payment protection.

The one thing we have not talked about is this: closeout inventory is finite.

A manufacturer discontinues a line. They have 8,000 sq ft left. They list it on PlankMarket. A buyer purchases 5,000 sq ft. The listing updates to 3,000 sq ft remaining. Another buyer takes it. The listing is gone.

That lot does not come back. There is no reorder. No restock. When it is gone, it is gone.

This is not pressure. It is how closeout works. The retailers who source from this channel understand that timing matters.

If you have been browsing and see something that fits a project or your showroom inventory needs, now is a reasonable time to act.

What you risk by waiting: the specific lot you are watching may sell. What you risk by buying: nothing beyond the purchase price -- your payment is escrowed until carrier pickup, and you have 48 hours to inspect after delivery.

From here, we will only email you when it is relevant. Saved search alerts. Order updates. The occasional note about new inventory categories or platform features.

Thanks for joining PlankMarket. We built this for flooring professionals who know there is a better way to source surplus inventory. We think you will see that on your first purchase.
