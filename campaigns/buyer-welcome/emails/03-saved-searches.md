# Email 3: Saved Searches

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Stop checking. Get notified instead." -- recommended
Safe bet. Direct benefit. Acknowledges the behavior (manually checking) and offers a better alternative. Short, punchy, matches the brand voice.

### B: "How to be first on new closeout lots"
Bold play. Competitive advantage framing. Implies that speed matters in closeout -- and saved searches give them an edge over other buyers.

### C: "Set it once, source on autopilot"
Personal touch. Emphasizes the low effort and ongoing value. "Source" is the preferred industry verb per the voice profile.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests efficiency messaging ("stop checking") against competitive speed messaging ("be first"). Reveals whether buyers are more pain-averse (hate the phone-around game) or gain-seeking (want first-mover advantage on lots).

## Preview Text
"Saved searches alert you the moment matching inventory is listed. Set your specs once."

## Send Timing
Day 3 -- Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Two days after the browse email. Gives them time to have looked around and understood the inventory. Thursday morning is a strong B2B send window.

## Email Copy

The phone-around game wastes your week.

Calling distributors. Emailing reps. Checking websites. Hoping someone has what you need at a price that works. By the time you hear about a good lot, someone else already bought it.

Saved searches fix this.

Tell PlankMarket what you are looking for:

- Material type and species
- Grade and condition
- Minimum and maximum sq ft
- Price range per sq ft
- Preferred regions for freight

Set it once. When a matching lot is listed, you get an alert. Before the listing is a day old. Before your competitors know it exists.

The best closeout lots move fast. Saved searches put you at the front of the line.

[Set Up a Saved Search]

You can create multiple saved searches. One for oak hardwood in select grade. Another for overstock LVP above 5,000 sq ft. Whatever your buyers are asking for.

**P.S.** No cost to set up saved searches. No cost to browse. You only pay the 3% buyer fee when you complete a purchase.
