# Email 2: Browse Inventory

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "What is on PlankMarket right now"
Safe bet. Curiosity-driven, simple. Invites them to look without pressure. Works well for new registrations who have not yet browsed.

### B: "Inventory your rep is not showing you" -- recommended
Bold play. Directly addresses the Hidden Channel angle. Creates a competitive information gap -- there is inventory available that their current sourcing channels are not surfacing.

### C: "Take a look before it moves"
Personal touch. Factual urgency -- closeout inventory does move. Short, conversational, creates a gentle pull to browse.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests the competitive angle ("your rep is not showing you") against factual scarcity ("before it moves"). Reveals whether buyers are more motivated by competitive advantage or time pressure.

## Preview Text
"Closeout hardwood, overstock LVP, discontinued engineered -- browse by material, species, or grade."

## Send Timing
Day 1 -- Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET
Day after registration. Buyers are still warm. B2B flooring professionals check email early morning before warehouse operations ramp up. Tuesday avoids the Monday inbox clearing rush.

## Email Copy

Most flooring retailers source through the same 3-4 distributors. Same catalogs. Same pricing. Same inventory everyone else sees.

PlankMarket is a different channel.

Manufacturers and distributors list surplus, closeout, and discontinued inventory here -- the lots that never make it into the standard catalog. First-quality product from lines they are winding down or overruns they need to move.

Right now you can browse by:

- Material type: hardwood, engineered, LVP/LVT, laminate, tile
- Species: oak, maple, hickory, walnut, and more
- Grade: select, #1 common, #2 common, rustic
- Condition: new overstock, closeout, discontinued

Every listing includes up to 44 flooring-specific data fields. Dimensions, finish, sq ft available, photos, location, and freight estimates. No calling around. No spec sheets over email. Everything in one place.

Pricing runs 30-60% below standard wholesale.

Inventory turns over. What you see today may not be there next week. That is not a sales line -- it is how closeout works.

**P.S.** Spot something interesting? You can buy at the listed price or make an offer. Every listing has a built-in negotiation tool.
