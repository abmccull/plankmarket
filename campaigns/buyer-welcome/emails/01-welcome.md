# Email 1: Welcome

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your PlankMarket account is live" -- recommended
Direct confirmation. Matches what they expect after registering. Highest open rate for welcome emails because it answers the immediate question: did my signup work?

### B: "Welcome to the surplus channel"
Bold play. Positions PlankMarket as an insider channel they now have access to. Creates a frame around the marketplace that competitors lack.

### C: "You are in -- here is what to do first"
Personal touch. Conversational, action-oriented. Signals that there is a clear next step and sets up the onboarding path.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether buyers respond to straightforward confirmation or aspirational framing. Reveals how this audience wants to be talked to -- practical or narrative.
