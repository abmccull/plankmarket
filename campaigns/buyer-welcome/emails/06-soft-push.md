# Email 6: Soft Push

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "From browse to delivery in 5 steps"
Safe bet. Process-oriented. Reduces the perceived complexity of buying on a new platform by framing it as a short, defined process.

### B: "Your first purchase on PlankMarket"
Bold play. Directly addresses the goal of the sequence. Assumes they are ready and frames the email as preparation for that moment.

### C: "How a PlankMarket order works" -- recommended
Personal touch. Low-pressure, informational framing. Does not push them to buy -- just explains the process. Builds confidence by removing unknowns.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests numbered-step framing ("5 steps") against open-ended informational framing ("how it works"). Reveals whether buyers prefer structured instruction or a conversational walkthrough.

## Preview Text
"Find it, buy it or make an offer, pay via Stripe, track the freight, inspect on delivery."

## Send Timing
Day 11 -- Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Late in the sequence. By now they have browsed, maybe set saved searches, and read about trust mechanics and margin math. This email removes the final friction: not knowing how the buying process actually works.

## Email Copy

You have browsed. You know what is available. Maybe you have a saved search running.

Here is what happens when you are ready to buy.

Step 1: Find a lot.
Browse listings or wait for a saved search alert. Filter by material, species, grade, condition, sq ft, and location. Every listing has detailed specs and photos.

Step 2: Buy or make an offer.
Two options on every listing. Buy Now at the listed price. Or Make an Offer if you want to negotiate. Sellers can accept, counter, or decline. The negotiation stays inside the platform -- no side emails, no phone tag.

Step 3: Pay.
Checkout through Stripe. Your payment goes into escrow. The seller does not receive funds until the carrier picks up the shipment.

Step 4: Track.
LTL freight is integrated. You get a tracking number and can follow the shipment from the seller's dock to yours. Real-time updates.

Step 5: Inspect and confirm.
After delivery, you have 48 hours to inspect the product. If everything matches the listing specs, the transaction completes and the seller gets paid. If something is off, file a dispute.

That is the full process. Five steps. No surprises.

The 3% buyer fee is calculated and shown at checkout before you confirm payment. You always know the total cost -- product, fee, and freight -- before you commit.
