# Campaign: Buyer Welcome

## Goal
Move new buyer registrations from signup to first purchase. Target: 40%+ profile completion rate, 25%+ saved search activation, 10%+ first purchase within 14 days.

## Sequence Type
Welcome

## Emails
7 emails over 14 days

## Angle
The Hidden Channel -- "Retailers are leaving margin on the table by paying full wholesale when manufacturers are sitting on closeout inventory they need to move -- PlankMarket connects the two."
Headline direction: "The inventory your competitors do not know exists."

## Audience Segment
Buyers: flooring retailers, contractors, builders. Verified professionals who source inventory for resale or projects. They think in sq ft, price per sq ft, species, grade, pallets. Primary motivation is margin improvement through below-market sourcing.

## Lead Magnet
None. This is a product welcome sequence triggered by buyer account registration, not a lead magnet download.

## Paid Offer
PlankMarket marketplace itself. No subscription fee. 3% buyer fee on completed purchases. The "conversion" is their first purchase on the platform.

## Bridge Logic
Signup means interest. The sequence bridges from "I signed up" to "I bought my first lot" by progressively reducing friction: complete profile (trust signal for sellers) -> browse inventory (see what is available) -> set saved searches (get notified on matches) -> make an offer or purchase (close the deal). Each email removes one barrier to the next action.

## Voice Notes
- Tone: Direct, trustworthy, urgent, grounded. Experienced sales rep at a trade show.
- Lead with numbers, not adjectives.
- Use industry terms naturally: species, grade, MOQ, LVP, engineered.
- "Surplus" not "dead inventory."
- Factual scarcity over manufactured urgency.
- No sign-off needed -- branded footer handles it.
- Sender: "PlankMarket"
- Avoid: "revolutionizing," "AI-powered," "exclusive," "hurry," "easy," "incredible," "solution"
- Subject lines: 40-60 characters, no ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation
- One primary CTA per email
