## Primary Positioning

Angle: The Depreciation Clock
Statement: Every day closeout flooring sits in a warehouse, it loses value -- PlankMarket is the fastest path from excess inventory to verified buyer, before the clock runs out.
Psychology: Manufacturers and distributors already feel the pain of holding costs and depreciation. Framing the marketplace around urgency and time-decay makes inaction the enemy, not a competitor.
Headline direction: "Your closeout inventory is losing value right now. Move it before the margin disappears."
Best for: Supplier-side acquisition, cold outreach to manufacturers and distributors sitting on excess stock

## Competitive Landscape Summary

Sophistication: Stage 2 -- growing awareness, few digital players, claims escalating around price savings
Primary alternative: Phone calls, email blasts to known contacts, regional trade shows, or sitting on inventory until it becomes obsolete

Saturated claims:
- "Save up to 90% off list price"
- "Buy direct from manufacturers and distributors"
- "The floor covering trade's online marketplace"

White space identified:
- Nobody leads with the cost of inaction (depreciation, warehouse carrying costs, obsolescence risk)
- No competitor emphasizes verified/vetted retailers as a trust mechanism for sellers
- Speed-to-liquidation is unclaimed -- existing platforms feel like listing sites, not velocity engines
- The two-sided trust problem (sellers worry about brand integrity, buyers worry about quality) has no champion
