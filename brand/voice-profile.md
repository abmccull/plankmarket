# PlankMarket Brand Voice Profile

Last updated: 2026-02-26

---

## 1. Brand Identity

**What PlankMarket is:** A B2B marketplace connecting flooring distributors and manufacturers with verified retailers to liquidate closeout, overstock, discontinued, and surplus inventory at wholesale prices.

**What PlankMarket is not:** A consumer-facing discount store. A generic liquidation auction site. A logistics company. A price-race-to-the-bottom platform.

**Brand name breakdown:** "Plank" (the product -- flooring) + "Market" (the mechanism -- a marketplace). Simple, literal, memorable. The logo splits the name into two colors: walnut brown for "Plank" and forest green for "Market."

**Tagline:** "The Smarter Way to Trade Surplus Flooring"

**Boilerplate (one-liner):** PlankMarket is the B2B marketplace for liquidation, overstock, and closeout flooring inventory.

**Boilerplate (two-liner):** PlankMarket connects flooring manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Trade overstock, discontinued, and closeout inventory directly with verified professionals.

## 2. Voice Attributes

PlankMarket's voice sits at the intersection of four qualities. Each attribute has a guardrail to prevent over-rotation.

| Attribute | What it means | Guardrail (never go here) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Direct** | Say it plainly. No jargon, no filler, no hedging. These are busy professionals who want the facts. | Never blunt or cold. We are direct, not curt. |
| **Trustworthy** | Every claim is specific and verifiable. We use real numbers, not vague promises. Verified sellers, transparent fees, actual sq ft. | Never stiff or legalese. Trust comes from clarity, not formality. |
| **Urgent** | Closeout inventory is finite. We communicate that without manufactured panic. The deals are real and they move. | Never desperate or high-pressure. No countdown timers on evergreen pages. No "ACT NOW!!!" |
| **Grounded** | We know flooring. We speak the language of the trade -- species, grades, pallets, freight. We earn respect by knowing the work. | Never elitist or gatekeeping. New retailers are welcome. |

### Voice spectrum positioning

```
Casual ----[----X---------]---- Formal
             ^
        PlankMarket sits here: professional but not corporate.
        Think: experienced sales rep at a trade show, not a press release.
```

## 3. Tone Shifts by Context

The voice stays consistent. The tone adjusts.

| Context | Tone shift | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Landing page / ads** | Confident + urgent. Lead with the value prop. Numbers over adjectives. | "Source surplus flooring at 30-60% below wholesale. Verified sellers. Integrated freight." |
| **Onboarding emails** | Warm + helpful. Guide without condescending. | "A complete profile helps sellers trust you. It only takes a minute." |
| **Transactional emails** | Clear + concise. Confirm what happened, say what's next. | "Your order is confirmed. The seller will provide shipping details within 48 hours." |
| **Error states / rejection** | Honest + constructive. Say what went wrong, then what to do. | "We were unable to verify your business at this time. You can resubmit with updated documents." |
| **Milestone / celebration** | Genuine + brief. Acknowledge the win, offer a next step. | "Your first listing is live. Here are some tips to maximize your sales." |
| **Dashboard / UI** | Minimal + functional. Labels, not sentences. | "Active Listings" / "Avg Days on Market" / "Revenue Over Time" |
| **Support** | Patient + knowledgeable. Never make the user feel stupid. | "Reply to this email or contact support@plankmarket.com" |

---

## 4. Writing Principles

### Lead with the number
Flooring professionals think in quantities: square feet, pallets, price per sq ft, percentage below wholesale. Put the number first.

- Yes: "30-60% below wholesale pricing on surplus hardwood"
- No: "Amazing deals on great flooring at incredible prices"

### One idea per sentence
Our audience skims. Short paragraphs. Bullet points over walls of text. If a sentence has two ideas, make it two sentences.

### Active voice, present tense
We build, connect, verify, move. Not "inventory will be made available" -- "inventory is available now."

### Specificity over superlatives
Never say "best" or "leading" or "premier" or "world-class." Say what we actually do.

- Yes: "Reach verified buyers across all 50 states"
- No: "The nation's premier flooring liquidation solution"

### Respect the reader's time
These are warehouse managers, purchasing directors, and business owners. They don't have time for fluff. Every sentence should either inform or motivate action.

## 5. Vocabulary Guide

### Preferred terms

| Use this | Not this | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| surplus flooring | excess stock / dead inventory | "Surplus" is neutral and professional. "Dead inventory" makes the product sound defective. |
| closeout | clearance | "Closeout" is the industry term for discontinued product lines. "Clearance" sounds retail/consumer. |
| overstock | overage | "Overstock" is universally understood. "Overage" is ambiguous. |
| verified professionals | trusted partners / vetted members | "Verified" is concrete (we actually check). "Trusted" is subjective. |
| wholesale pricing | discount pricing / cheap | "Wholesale" is the accurate framing. "Discount" and "cheap" devalue the product. |
| lot / listing | deal / offer | "Lot" is B2B liquidation language. "Deal" sounds like a consumer promo. ("Offer" is reserved for buyer-to-seller negotiation.) |
| freight | shipping | Both are acceptable, but "freight" signals B2B scale -- pallets and truckloads, not boxes. Use "shipping" in buyer-facing UI where clarity matters more. |
| sq ft / square footage | square feet (in dense UI) | Abbreviate in data-heavy contexts (listing cards, tables). Spell out in marketing copy. |
| payout | payment to seller | "Payout" is clean and specific to marketplace seller disbursements. |
| fee | commission / charge | "Fee" is transparent. "Commission" implies agent relationship. |
| material type | flooring category | Match the database/filter terminology for consistency. |

### Industry terms to use naturally (not to explain)
- Species (oak, maple, hickory, walnut)
- Grade (select, #1 common, #2 common, cabin, rustic)
- Finish (wire-brushed, hand-scraped, matte, semi-gloss)
- Condition (new overstock, discontinued, closeout, seconds, remnants)
- MOQ (minimum order quantity)
- LVP/LVT (luxury vinyl plank/tile)
- Engineered vs. solid hardwood

Our audience knows these terms. Using them without explanation signals that we are part of the trade, not outsiders.

### Words and phrases to avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "Revolutionizing" / "disrupting" | Startup jargon that alienates a traditional industry |
| "AI-powered" / "smart" / "intelligent" | Unless referring to a specific AI feature. Our audience cares about results, not technology branding. |
| "Exclusive" / "VIP" / "elite" | We are a marketplace for professionals, not a members-only club |
| "Hurry" / "Don't miss out" / "Last chance" | Manufactured urgency. The inventory scarcity is real -- state it factually instead. |
| "Easy" / "simple" / "just" | Minimizing words. Listing inventory and managing freight are real work. Don't trivialize it. |
| "Incredible" / "amazing" / "unbelievable" | Superlatives that mean nothing. Use numbers instead. |
| "Solution" / "leverage" / "synergy" | Corporate buzzwords that erode trust |
| "Click here" | Outdated CTA pattern. Use descriptive link text. |

## 6. Audience-Specific Messaging

### For Buyers (Retailers)

**Primary motivation:** Source quality flooring inventory at below-market prices to improve margins.

**Secondary motivations:** Reliable supply of closeout products. Variety of species, grades, and conditions. Confidence that they're buying from verified sellers.

**Key messages:**
- Source premium surplus flooring at 30-60% below wholesale
- Verified sellers with detailed specs and photos
- Integrated freight quotes -- no separate logistics calls
- Set saved search alerts for the products you need
- Make offers or buy now -- your choice

**Tone:** Confident, deal-oriented. Emphasize the margin opportunity and product quality.

**Pain points to address:**
- "Is this product actually good, or is it surplus for a reason?" -> Detailed specs, photos, condition labels, seller verification
- "Can I trust this seller?" -> Verification badges, reviews, transparent ratings
- "What about shipping costs?" -> Integrated freight quotes at checkout
- "I need specific products, not random lots" -> Saved searches with alerts, granular filters (material, species, grade, condition, location)

### For Sellers (Distributors / Manufacturers)

**Primary motivation:** Move surplus inventory quickly and recover capital tied up in warehouse space.

**Secondary motivations:** Reach buyers they wouldn't find through their existing sales channels. Predictable, low-friction payouts.

**Key messages:**
- Liquidate overstock and closeout inventory fast
- Reach verified buyers across all 50 states
- Get paid in 3-5 days after order completion
- 2% fee only when you sell -- no listing fees
- Guided listing form -- upload specs, photos, and go live

**Tone:** Efficient, results-focused. Emphasize speed of liquidation and breadth of buyer reach.

**Pain points to address:**
- "Will my surplus actually sell?" -> Buyer network size, saved search alerts that notify buyers, request board where buyers post what they need
- "I don't want to spend hours creating listings" -> Guided form, AI spec sheet extraction, CSV bulk upload
- "When do I get paid?" -> 3-5 day payouts via Stripe
- "How much does it cost?" -> 2% seller fee, no listing fees, transparent pricing

## 7. CTAs and Microcopy

### Primary CTAs
| Context | CTA | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Homepage (buyer) | "Explore buyer benefits" / "Sign Up as Buyer" | First CTA is exploratory, second is commitment |
| Homepage (seller) | "Explore seller benefits" / "Sign Up as Seller" | Mirror buyer structure |
| Listing page | "Buy Now" / "Make an Offer" | Two clear purchase paths |
| Registration | "Create Account" | Neutral -- role is selected within the form |
| Email | "Go to Dashboard" / "View Your Listings" / "Browse Listings" | Action-specific, destination-clear |
| Browse CTA | "View all listings" | Lowercase, understated -- for the visitor who just wants to look |

### Microcopy patterns
- **Trust signals:** "Verified Professionals" / "Wholesale Pricing" / "Integrated Freight" -- noun phrases, not sentences
- **Stats:** Use the format "Number + Unit" -- "6 Material Categories" / "All 50 US States" / "3-5 Days Seller Payouts"
- **Empty states:** Be helpful, not cute. "No listings match your filters. Try broadening your search." Not "Oops! Nothing here!"
- **Success states:** Brief acknowledgment + next step. "Account created. Verify your business before transacting."
- **Error states:** What happened + what to do. Never blame the user.
- **Form labels:** Sentence case, no colons. "Business Email" not "BUSINESS EMAIL:" or "Enter your business email address"
- **Tooltips:** One sentence max. Answer "what does this mean?" not "here is everything about this topic."

## 8. Visual Voice (Copy + Design Alignment)

### Color-to-copy mapping
The brand's visual identity reinforces the voice:

| Color | CSS Variable | Usage | Copy tone it supports |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------------------|
| Walnut brown | `--primary: oklch(0.40 0.10 55)` | Primary actions, "Plank" wordmark, buttons | Grounded, trustworthy |
| Forest green | `--secondary: oklch(0.42 0.09 155)` | "Market" wordmark, seller accents, active nav | Growth, commerce, action |
| Soft gold | `--accent: oklch(0.85 0.10 85)` | Badges, highlights, premium elements | Value, quality, warmth |
| Warm ivory | `--background: oklch(0.975 0.005 85)` | Page backgrounds | Clean but not sterile |

### Typography voice
- **Display font (DM Serif):** Used for headings. Adds warmth and gravitas to a marketplace that could otherwise feel cold and transactional.
- **Body font (Geist Sans):** Clean, modern, highly legible. Does not compete with the content.
- **Headlines:** Title case for major headings ("The Smarter Way to Trade Surplus Flooring"). Sentence case for subheadings and section titles ("Track your performance and revenue").

### Photography direction
- Show the product (planks, pallets, warehouse settings), not lifestyle scenes
- Warm tones that match the brand palette
- Real warehouse/trade show environments over studio shots
- When showing people: professionals in work settings, not stock photo models

## 9. Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Website
- Homepage leads with the buyer/seller fork -- let visitors self-select immediately
- Use concrete numbers in the stats bar (categories, states, fees, payout speed)
- Bottom CTA always offers both buyer and seller signup paths
- Footer reinforces the one-liner boilerplate

### Email
- Subject lines: 40-60 characters, no ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation
- Preview text: Complete the thought the subject line starts
- Body: Short paragraphs, 2-3 sentences max. Bullet points for lists.
- One primary CTA per email. Place it after the key message.
- Sign-off: No sign-off needed -- the branded footer handles it
- Sender: "PlankMarket" (not a person's name, until the team is large enough for personal sender names to mean something)

### Ads (Paid Search / Social)
- Lead with the value proposition, not the brand name
- Include a specific number: "30-60% below wholesale" / "2% seller fee" / "3-5 day payouts"
- Separate buyer and seller ad sets -- different pain points, different CTAs
- Buyer ads: margin opportunity, product quality, verified sellers
- Seller ads: speed of liquidation, buyer reach, low fees

### Social Media (if applicable)
- Share new notable listings (large lots, unusual species, deep discounts)
- Industry news relevant to supply chain, housing starts, flooring trends
- No memes, no emojis-heavy posts, no "engagement bait"
- LinkedIn is the primary channel for B2B flooring professionals

## 11. Anti-Patterns (Things We Never Do)

1. **Never use fake urgency.** The scarcity of closeout inventory is real. State remaining quantities factually. Do not add countdown timers to non-time-limited offers.

2. **Never denigrate the product.** Surplus flooring is not damaged or defective (unless explicitly labeled as "seconds" or "slight damage"). It is quality product from discontinued lines, overproduction, or business changes.

3. **Never talk down to the audience.** These are experienced trade professionals. Don't explain what hardwood flooring is. Don't say "Did you know...?" as a rhetorical device.

4. **Never use consumer retail language.** No "sale," "clearance," "bargain," "steal." Use "closeout," "surplus," "overstock," "wholesale."

5. **Never make promises we can't back up.** "Thousands of buyers" only when we have thousands of buyers. "Nationwide coverage" only when we actually serve all 50 states. Every stat on the site should be defensible.

6. **Never hide fees.** The 3% buyer fee and 2% seller fee are features, not fine print. State them prominently.

7. **Never use stock photos of smiling people pointing at laptops.** Real warehouses, real flooring, real trade environments.

## 12. Voice Checklist (For Reviewing Copy)

Before publishing any copy, verify:

- [ ] Does it lead with a specific benefit or number, not a vague claim?
- [ ] Would a flooring purchasing director find this credible?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place? (Delete anything that doesn't inform or motivate.)
- [ ] Are we using industry terms correctly and naturally?
- [ ] Is the CTA clear about what happens when you click?
- [ ] Does the tone match the context? (Marketing = confident. Support = patient. Error = constructive.)
- [ ] Are we avoiding all words/phrases on the "avoid" list?
- [ ] Would this copy work if you removed the brand name? (i.e., is it specific enough to PlankMarket?)
